The goal is to enable users to reproduce part of the programming shown 
during the [Nancy Data Science Meetup on September 15, 2017](https://www.meetup.com/nancydatascience/events/242251378/).
For each language example, we assume the user has installed 
Julia, python or R on their system.
If necessary, the notebooks provide additional instructions on 
how to install other software packages.

Thank you for trying the examples yourself.
You can provide feedback in the [list of issues](https://github.com/nancydatascience/nds/issues).
